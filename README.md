# e-commerce Basket App
### Take-home challenge for SOON_

This project was produced in response to flow 1 of the [SOON_BasketApp challenge](https://thisissoon.notion.site/thisissoon/FAC-Screening-edda4f70b58d46fda9501f98398c1753)

The challenge demonstrates some of my knowledge and experience of frontend web development using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### User Flow

This simple shopping app fragment allows the user to...

* view a product with details: title, description, image, price
* add a quantity of the product to the basket
* see the total item count in the basket from the header

In addition to the challenge requirements, the user is...
* updated on current stock levels of the current item after adding to basket
* prevented from adding out-of-stock items
